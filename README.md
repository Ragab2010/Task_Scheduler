# Task Scheduler Performance Analyzer Tool

This is a Task Scheduler Performance Analyzer Tool developed in C++ to evaluate and compare various task scheduling strategies based on their execution times.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (C++17 or higher)
- CMake (for building the project)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Build the project using CMake and your C++ compiler.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

3. Run the compiled executable.

```bash
./TaskSchedulerProject
```

## Usage

- Follow the on-screen instructions to set the number of tasks and preferences for scheduling strategies.
- The tool will generate random execution times and intervals for tasks.
- The tool will execute the selected scheduling strategies, record execution times, and generate performance reports.
- Summary and detailed reports will be displayed.
- You can make informed decisions about selecting the most efficient task scheduling strategy based on performance analysis.
